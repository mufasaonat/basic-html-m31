        <b>Agnes is a very intelligent, educated and curious girl. Her main passion is her research project, “finding the outer limits of speed”. She spends most of the time on her research project, sometimes she can get even obsessed about it. Agnes regularly misses out on races or classes to prioritize her research. She is not willing to sacrifice any time for other activities, such as cooking or training. Agnes is also very excited and determined about her scientific experiments.[</b>
