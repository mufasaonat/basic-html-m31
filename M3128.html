            <h3>Backgound:</h3>
        Ethan Winters was an American mutant trained as a systems engineer. One of many mutant victims of biological weaponry, Winters was infected with a weaponized species of "Mold" during the 2017 Dulvey incident. He and his wife Mia were rescued by the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, and were placed under witness protection in Eastern Europe. This protection ultimately unraveled in February 2021 when their daughter, Rosemary, was abducted by Mother Miranda. Winters was successful in rescuing Rosemary, but gave his life to save his daughter from Miranda.
